Forensics Tool Analysis Team

### Purpose

The purpose of this is to test the analysis component of each of our forensic toolkits. Since the user story we will be testing is “As a **Computer Forensic Analyst**, I want to **detect and recover deleted data** so I can **support/define a suspect's intent**”, we will be analyzing and determining what the forensic toolkits miss or fail to recover. The deleted VM that we will be running our toolkits against has eight seperate files that were saved in various locations and then different tools were then used to deleted all eight of these files.

Comments:
After analyzing the carved image of the deleted drive I was not able to find any evidence of the files that were deleted. Since I was not able to find them, I obviously was unable to recover the information either.
