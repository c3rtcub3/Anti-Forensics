# Assessment Summary


The overall goal of the project was to test and evaluate the performance of popular forensic toolkits against anti-forensic techniques. The beginning of our project started with researching and selecting the forensic toolkits that we would evaluate: Sans SIFT, Caine and DFF. Once the set of toolkits had been selected, we identified and researched the tools and techniques surrounding three categories of anti-forensics: Data Hiding, Data Destruction and Data Alteration ([Associated Research](/Documentation/Research/)). Once all research had been conducted, the particular anti-forensic tools and techniques were leveraged to construct a stand-alone virtual machine which would serve as our platform for evaluating each of the forensic toolkits ([Virtual Machine Setup](/Documentation/VM/)) ([Evaluation Template](/Documentation/Evaluation/)). Following the setup of these systems, each of the chosen toolkits were used to analyze the virtual machine's image. With these results recorded, we took our findings from each of the tests and created reports that evaluated the performance of these toolkits in countering anti-forensics techniques that we used ([Resulting Reports](/Documentation/Reports/)).
