Forensics Tool Analysis Team

### Purpose

The purpose of this is to test the analysis component of each of our forensic toolkits. Since the user story we will be testing is “As a **Computer Forensic Analyst**, I want to **identify and understand system contents** so I can **develop an overview of user activity**”, we will be investigate the ability of forensic toolkits to analyze and recover manipulated system contents. Such anti-forensic techniques involving the manipulation of system contents for the goal of trail obfuscation have been applied to the altered VM which will serve as a baseline for identifying the toolkit's ability to counteract such techniques.
